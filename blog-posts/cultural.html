<h3>Damn You, Stereotype Threat</h3>
</span>	
</a>

<span class="post 5" style="display:;">

<p>In 1995, Steele and Aronson published a study that formally introduced the stereotype threat. The researchers gave a difficult portion of the GRE to African-American and European-American participants. They attempted to indirectly evoke the cognitive availability of a stereotype in the participants by describing one of the tests as "diagnostic of intellectual ability". They found that African-Americans scored lower on this test. They attributed this underperformance to the risk that an individual felt that doing so would confirm as self-characteristic the negative stereotype about one's group. The negative stereotype in this study presumably being that African-Americans perform more poorly than European-Americans on standardized tests.</p>

<p>Hundreds of studies exhibit the effects of stereotype threat on performance, and it transcends race to gender, age and so on. The key that makes this threat damaging appears to be in the <i>awareness</i> of the stereotype. An individual commented on The Atlantic article entitled "Thin Ice: Stereotype Threat and Black College Students". He claims to be an African who recently came to America, and so had not been exposed to the negative stereotypes regarding intelligence that are directed at African-Americans. As such, he had been able to "disregard [his] group identity as a factor in most roles". He had no conception of how his "blackness" affected him academically, so it did not affect him.</p>

<p>The preceding anecdote offers a helpful point when considering how to attenuate the stereotype threat. While awareness of stereotypes weighs on an individual in certain situations, perhaps awareness of the concept of the stereotype threat is enough to mitigate it to some degree. In a 100-level psychology or sociology class, you might learn about a number of biases or predispositions that seem to come pre-loaded in the human brain. Some serve as helpful heuristics, but many can be harmful to making the best judgments (i.e. stereotyping). I find that learning about and becoming aware that these notions can sneak into cognition is paramount to optimum critical thinking, from big-time resolutions down to every-day decisions.</p>

<p>As individuals, we will have a tough time directly combating prevalent stereotypes, but we do have some control over how these stereotypes affect our performance. By understanding that stereotype threat "is a thing", we can identify the situations wherein it is likely to rear its ugly head. When we find ourselves in those situations, we are prepared for our fears because they are familiar, and we can gain confidence in our abilities in spite of what we perceive the stereotype to dictate of our aptitude. The stereotype may be alive and well, but the <i>threat</i> we feel that apprehends our flair is but within ourselves.</p>

<h3>Pair Programming</h3>
</span>	
</a>

<span class="post 4" style="display:none;">
<p><b><i>Two heads are better than one</i></b>, goes the 16th century proverb. For the most part, I'm inclined to agree. Two minds can blast any task with a 2x beam of creative cognitivity. But do you get 2x the output? DBC has given me an opportunity to tackle new challenges in programming with a pair. While I'm used to working in groups to complete projects, group work usually involves a great dividing of the tasks. Pairing is more like tutoring, wherein two people work on the same exact problem at the same exact time. Except, there is no mentor-student relationship; the pair is theoretically in the same knowledge ballpark.</p>

<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/pear.jpg" style="float:left; padding-bottom:0;">
<p>So, pair programming is new to me, as I think it is for many of my pair peers, especially over a video chat. Like anything new, pairing takes some getting used to. Needless to say, my last session ran more smoothly than my first session. At the end of my sessions, I generally feel a sense of accomplishment, not only from completing a challenge, but from navigating newfound knowledge in semi-synchronized style. All this accomplishing can be exhausting. As opposed to only learning this rather difficult material en solo, pairing demands the added labor of being considerate of another's learning. You  will never be on the exact same page with your pair. Someone always knows more about something, if not everything, in the realm of the challenge du jour. While it is fairly simple to relay information and fill in the knowledge gaps, it can be tricky to do so in a driver/navigator agreement.</p>

<p>For example, if I'm driving, I'm sharing my screen and typing in the code as instructed by the navigator. If I have an idea that might alter our course, I would politely wait until the navigator is finished with the thought before raising it. When I propose my solution, I would ideally be navigating then and our roles would switch. We would have to then work out of two different files. That's why we have Stypi, right? Stypi is a nice idea, but it is buggy and impractical and I'm under the impression that I'm not alone in abandoning it. As a convenient result, I end up navigating and driving when I have an idea. That doesn't follow the driver/navigator protocol! Of course, this would all be easier to do in person.</p>

<p>Aside from the inefficiency and maybe stress that are borne in maintaining a driver/navigator relationship, pair programming is a terrific strategy for <i>learning</i>. Even if there is a significant knowledge gap between the pair, neither party walks away empty handed. The more learned one benefits from teaching and guiding, and exposure to varying insights and approaches fortifies the less tangible problem-solving skills for both parties. That being said, I'm skeptical that pairing would be best practice in business, wherein budgets and finite human resources would not allow for such duplication of efforts and intermittent learning. The client pays for a product, not for developers to grow existentially.</p>

<p>If you've made it this far, you can stay for a brief chat about feedback because it is so important here at DBC. Exchanging feedback is a challenge in itself because people are hesitant to be say negative things about one another. Yes, I know, it's not "negative" feedback, it's <i>constructive</i>. But, there is a hint of "you did not do this thing as good as I would have liked" in every constructive feedback, and even that can be hard for us to read and write. Because giving constructive feedback is part of the requirement, in giving feedback, I try to always come up with something that my pair could improve, even if it wasn't something that struck me at the time of our session. Sometimes I have to dig for it. I hope this does not come across as nit pickin'. In light of these attempts, I was surprised when I read the feedback @me because it was so positive. I would've been harder on myself.</p>

<p><b>TLDR</b>; Pair programming and feedback are often tedious and uncomfortable, but serve as invaluable tools to becoming world-class beginners.</p>

<h3>The Tech Gender Gap... Problem?</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 3" style="display:none;">
<h4>A Scary Number</h4>
<p>Google recently released statistics of its employee breakdown by gender. Its tech workforce is about 17% women. That's almost 5 to 1 men. Surprised? Yes. Alarmed? Not necessarily.</p>

<p>No doubt, men vastly outnumber women when it comes to working in this industry. As a reaction, companies have set up programs and committed funds to getting more women into programming. Case in point: Google has promised to spend $50 million to teach girls how to code. It has to do <i>something</i>, right!? 17% does not equal 50%! It's bad PR.</p>

<h4>When it's a Problem</h4>
<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/mens_room.jpg" style="float:left; padding-bottom:0;">
<p>An online search will return countless articles about the gender gap problem. But far fewer actually explain <i>why gap = problem</i>. To make this logical leap at face value could be a mistake. Let's look at a potential cause and a potential effect that <i>would</i> be evidence of a problem.</p>

<p>Cause = sexism. Discrimination based on gender. Women are not allowed into tech because the gatekeepers have something against the XX. Job qualifications and aptitude have nothing to do with it - if you are a woman, your would-be boss won't hire you and your could-be co-workers won't play nicely. If sexism is at the root of the gender gap, then we have a problem. The gap isn't the problem though; it's the result of a much bigger problem with society.</p>

<p>Regardless of the cause for the gender gap, the he-she disparity could be an issue for the industry if women are not represented proportionately. Women make up over half the world's population, and half of video game players. Certainly, we don't want decision makers and designers to be out of touch with the relevant market. The field has switched from mostly female to mostly male since the '60s. The stereotypical computer programmer is often an intelligent, but socially inept male. Has this caused problems in the end products? Have we experienced communication breakdown between tech developers and the end users, based on gender proportion difference on either side? If the answer is yes in the future, there may be a free market flow of women to tech.<p>

<h4>Solutions</h4>
<p>Of course, there may be other issues at play, but the aforementioned comprise a great deal of the concern in discussions about the tech gender gap. Likewise, there could be a plethora of unproblematic reasons as well. My point is to question the actual "problem" because it dictates the best solution. The big idea recently is to throw money at the gender gap in order to close it. Why? Money won't change sexism, if that is the problem. Money could potentially solve accessibility problems should they exist, but lack of funding for education and job placement for females specifically does not seem to be the issue. Finally, money creates incentives, for all people. To pump money into education is to provide a reason for people to try learning about programming, that isn't related to passion for programming. Is money the reason why we want people to do something, or lack thereof the cause for why people aren't doing it?</p>

<p>So, the first step to finding a solution to the tech gender gap problem is to determine if there is a problem. Men and women are different, and cultural tendencies complex. Women dominate nursing at even more lopsided ratios than men do tech. Our goal should be to create an environment that fosters opportunity for each <i>person</i> to pursue a career as he or she pleases, and not necessarily focus on making two variables equal.</p>

<h3>Thinking and Learning about Thinking and Learning</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 2" style="display:none;">
<p>
<b>Dr. Anthony Gregorc brought us the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles Model</a> in 1984.</b> If you take a short thinking style quiz, Dr. G will tell you how your mind works. My mind is <i>Concrete Random</i>. My <i>concrete</i> perceptual quality enables me to process information by sensing and doing what's in front of me, versus visualizing and imagining in the <i>abstract</i>. My <i>random</i> ordering ability allows me to organize information in chunks, as opposed to in a <i>sequential</i>, linear way.
</p>

<p>
Interpreted, I solve problems when I'm tinkering. I'm not convinced until I've seen something work by my own hands. Reading a solution or textbook isn't going to cut it. I don't want to document my work or think about what steps I took. I know when I understand it and that's the end of it. And I absolutely hate memorizing things.
</p>

<p>
This style of learning is great for conquering the toughest challenges in DBC because a lot is unknown and I am comfortable diving right in. However, this approach poses some challenges of its own in the course. I often find myself going down rabbit holes and struggling to finish the required tasks in a timely manner. I find reflections and "check-box" to-do lists very cumbersome. I'd rather spend that time experimenting with concepts that I've discovered that might be outside the scope of what's asked of me. To address these pitfalls, I've made it a priority to finish the tasks and reflections first before allowing myself to venture down paths of curiosity.
</p>

<p>
<b>Now let's look at growth vs. fixed mindset.</b> A growth mindset is a tendency for one to believe that intelligence can be developed; someone with a growth mindset tends to embrace effort, challenges setbacks and criticism. A fixed mindset is a tendency for one to believe that intelligence is static, yet maintain the the desire to appear smart to others; someone with a fixed mindset tends to shy away from challenges, avoid effort, become discouraged by setbacks and be defensive towards criticism.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Dr. Gregorc's four buckets for learning styles, this dichotomy of mindsets seems to present the "correct" attribute: a growth mindset. I think it's helpful to not try convince yourself that you have the ideal growth mindset; rather, you should strive for a growth mindset regardless of where you stand. <i>Grow</i> the growth mindset.
</p>

<p>
In DBC, I aim to embrace my Mind Style while branching outside of my comfort zone. I make it a priority to put thought into my reflections after each challenge. I make time to pair with others on challenges, even if I'd prefer to tackle them alone. I've already experienced the benefit of working with people of varying coding experience. I can learn a great deal from someone with more skills because they simply have a lot to show me. Alternatively, I can solidify my current understanding of concepts and by practicing my ability to explain concepts to someone more novice.

<h3>Pep Talk</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 1" style="display:none;">
<p>
Shereef's Fireside Chat is by far the most motivational piece I have ever seen filmed on a web cam. As I watched his video to attempt to wrap up week 1 prep material during the hours of the night I should be sleeping, I felt a great sense of purpose: a late-night call to arms, but also a reality check. What have I gotten myself into!? I have a better sense now then I did before.</p>

<p>
I understand that participating in Dev Bootcamp is like working in the kitchen with a bunch of aspiring chefs to make a big batch of experimental soup, with some hair in it... and it sounds delicious. I really appreciate an approach to learning wherein the students and teachers have an "in this together" mentality to create something wonderful through intense, focused effort; this is in stark contrast to the consumerist education we've come to expect.</p>

<p>
Shereef's response to listener questions in the chat was encouraging because it brought about a discussion that was ever so relevant to my own concerns. While the answers didn't exactly alleviate my fears, they made me feel that I was among others, and that it will be ok, if I'm willing to give it my all. I'm ready for an adventure.<p>
