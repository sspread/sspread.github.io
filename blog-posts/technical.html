<h3>Dealing a Poker Hand in Ruby</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 6" style="display:none;">
<p>In this piece, I'm going to run through a short Ruby program I wrote to deal a hand of poker. I will discuss classes and instance variables, among other concepts. Let's take it step by step.</p>

<img class="image_full" src="../unit1_projects/images/poker_initialize.PNG">

<p> First, we must define a new <span class="code">class PokerHand</span> as a blueprint to contain our methods and characterisics pertaining to a hand of poker. The first method in a new class is always going to be <span class="code">#initialize</span>.  When you create a new instance of the class PokerHand (i.e. an individual hand), you call <span class="code">#new</span> on the class, which automatically looks for and executes <span class="code">#initialize</span> within the class definition. Let's do that now.</p>

<p span class="code">
hand1=PokerHand.new(5)
<br><span class="output">=> There are 5 players.</span>
</P>

<p>We put a <span class="code">5</span> as the argument when creating the new class, which is interpreted by <span class="code">#initialize</span> as the number of players in our game. Behind the scenes, <span class="code">#initialize</span> also created a deck of cards, shuffled them, and dealt two to each player! I know, you want to see what you were dealt, right? Let's write another method to access the array value of the <span class="code">:hero</span> hash key.</p>

<img class="image_full" src="../unit1_projects/images/poker_hero_hand.PNG">
<br>
<p span class="code">
hand1.hero_hand
<br><span class="output">=> Your hand is ["6c", "6s"]</span>
</p>

<p>Not bad, pocket 6's! See the '@' attached to our <span class="code">@players</span> hash variable? That makes it an <i>instance variable</i> that our program can access across methods in our new PokerHand class, so long as it pertains to the same instance (i.e. <span class="code">hand1</span>). Let's skip the betting for now and see a flop!</p>

<img class="image_full" src="../unit1_projects/images/poker_flop.PNG">
<br>
<p span class="code">
hand1.flop
<br><span class="output">=> Flop: ["Ac", "3s", "Jc"]</span>
</p>

<p>Probably not the flop we wanted to see, but our program is working! Let's write one more method to see our opponent's hands.</p>

<img class="image_full" src="../unit1_projects/images/poker_villain_hand.PNG">
<br>
<p span class="code">
hand1.villain_hand(:two)
<br><span class="output">=> private method 'villain_hand' called for #(PokerHand:0x2c92248) (NoMethodError)</span>
</p>

<p>Not so fast! I told Ruby that <span class="code">#villain_hand</span> is <span class="code">private</span>. This means that only our program can access this method and see player two's hand (or any of our opponent's hands, for that matter). We might have our program call this private method later on when we extend it to find out who wins, but that's for another day.</p>

<h3>Ruby's The Enumerables</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 5" style="display:none;">
<p>An enumerable is collection of information that is able to be enumerated. To enumerate means to process the elements in the collection, piece by piece. You might feel like an enumerable at the DMV.</p>

<p>Now, Ruby has its own idea of enumerables, not unlike our English definition above. But, it's a little confusing when you first learn it, as I myself am doing along with you. Let me ramble off my understanding now. This is not for you; it is for me. Ahem...</p>

<p>If you ask ruby what class <i>Enumerable</i> is <span class="code">Enumerable.class</span>, it will return <span class="code output">Module</span>. It is used as a mixin in the Array class. Modules group together methods, classes and constants. Modules are similar to classes in this way, but you cannot create objects based on modules. Modules provide a namespace and allow you to share the functionality of instance methods between classes (mixins). <i>Enumerator</i> is a <i>Class</i> class. The Array class returns an <i>Enumerator</i> object when no block is given to <i>#each</i>. The <i>Enumerator</i> allows us to chain methods together indefinitely, as the previous chained methods will not be given blocks.</p>

<p>OK back to what we really came here to do. Let's discuss the <i>Enumerable#group_by</i> method. <i>#group_by</i> groups a collection by the criteria provided in the block. It returns a hash where each key represents a group whose values are an array containing its members.</p>

<p>An example...</p>

<p class="code">
fish_names = ["Nemo", "Bruce", "Marlin", "Glut", "Dory", "Coral", "Blenny"]
<br>fish_names.group_by{|name| name.length}
<br><span class="output">=> {4=>["Nemo", "Glut", "Dory"], 5=>["Bruce", "Coral"], 6=>["Marlin", "Blenny"]}</span>
</p>

<p><i>#group_by</i> grouped the names by their length, as specified in the block. Now let's omit the block and see what ruby returns...</p>

<p class="code">fish_names.group_by
<br><span class="output">=> #(Enumerator: ["Nemo", "Bruce", "Marlin", "Glut", "Dory", "Coral", "Blenny"]:group_by)</span>
</p>

<p>Now we could store that <i>Enumerator</i> as a variable and save it for later. What use is this <i>#group_by</i> Enumerator without any grouping criteria? I have no idea.</p>

<h3>JavaScript in Web Development</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 4" style="display:none;">
<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/javascript.jpg" style="width:19%; padding:0;">

<p class="text" style="width:79%; padding:0;">
<b>JavaScript is a computer language</b> commonly used in web development. To understand JavaScript's role in the web, we must first establish a concept called client-side programming. The client is the computer that communicates with the server. You might think of the client as your laptop. Instead of only pointing to a file, the web server can run a program process the file before sending it to the client. This makes the web more dynamic. Alternatively, the <i>client</i> can run that program to process the file after it receives it. This client-side program is written in JavaScript. Let's look at some features and pitfalls. 
</p>

<span class="text">
<p>
<b>We like JavaScript!</b>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><i>JavaSript is fast.</i> It executes on the client side and reduces strain on the web server and saves bandwith.</li>
<li><i>JavaScript is compatible.</i> It interacts with the user's web browser, so it is supported on any platform that supports that browser.</li>
<li><i>JavaScript is easy.</i> It uses the DOM model so it can already recognize the objects on web pages.</li>
<li><i>JavaScript is extendible</i>. Developers can write snippets that users can download that will interact with certain web pages and enhance functionality.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</span>

<span class="text">
<p>
<b>Not so fast...</b>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><i>JavaSript can be dangerous.</i> Developers can write JavaScript programs that execute on the client's computer to do something that the user did not intend. The program could attack the client's system and/or send out private information. Although browsers limit JavaScripts, capabilities, malicious developers periodically find ways to circumvent the rules.</li>
<li><i>JavaScript can be inconsistent across browsers.</i> Because JavaScript relies on the end user, developers cannot perfectly tailor their programs to varying browsers, settings and general environments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Learning CSS - Padding, Border and Margin</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 3" style="display:none;">
<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/margin.jpg" style="float: left; padding-bottom:0;">

<p class="text" style="padding:0;">
The skeleton of a web site is constructed from HTML. Instead of bones, HTML defines all of its elements as boxes. Then comes CSS to flesh out the web site and make it beautiful. CSS uses the box model to wrap layers around the box defined by HTML. Each of these layers has unique properties.
</p>
<p>
<b>Content</b> is at the center of the box model. We can see content in blue. Content is the box that holds holds the site's text and images.
</p> 
<p>
<b>Padding</b> creates a space around the content. Padding takes the background color defined by the content. The brown highlights that appear around the menu items on this page upon hover are created by padding.
</p>
<p>
<b>Border</b> surrounds the padding and content. It takes the color and design (i.e. solid, dotted, rounded corners) defined by the content. The blue underline on the header of this page is created with a border surrounding only the bottom of the header box.
</p>
<p>
<b>Margin</b> establishes an invisible force field around the whole package. The blank space above the navigation bar and on either side of the main content of this page are created by margins.
</p>
<p>
Note: the differences between padding, border and margin can be be unclear because they can be used interchangeably at times. For example, I could indent the title of this page "Tech" by using left margin or left padding. This is possible because there is no border around the content and we are not dealing with different background colors. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, the thickness of each layer begins at the inner layer and extends outwards. When designing a web site, remember that the actual height and width of an element is the sum of the content, plus the layers added by padding, border and margin.

<h3>Websites - Wireframed</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 2" style="display:none;">
<p> A wireframe is a simplified blueprint of a screen design. Check out the wireframe versions of the websites I mentioned on my Technical Blog page. Click the image for a bigger version.</p>

<a href="../unit1_projects/images/spotify_wire.png" target="_blank">
<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/spotify_wire.png"></a>
<p class="text">
<b>Spotify.com</b> - There isn't much to read upon initial view. The home screen is to the point. It's main purpose is to draw in the viewer, as visitors of this website (as opposed to the application) are usually not yet subscribers. The huge image is followed by a potpourri of album art scattered about the bottom of the page. Because these smaller images are covered, it invites the user to scroll down: that's where the real presentation is made.
</p>

<a href="../unit1_projects/images/css-tricks_wire.png" target="_blank">
<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/css-tricks_wire.png"></a>
<p class="text">
<b>css-tricks.com</b> - One of the most appealing things about this site is the beautiful color scheme. The wireframe takes that away from us. What we now realize is that half of the view is basically header and nav bar. There isn't much in terms of content before scrolling down to read what you came for. There is considerable space dedicated to treehouse, so it's safe to assume they're in cahootz. Nevertheless, the simplicity of this layout is appealing.
</p>

<a href="../unit1_projects/images/github_wire.png" target="_blank">
<img class = "image" src="../unit1_projects/images/github_wire.png"></a>
<p class="text">
<b>GitHub.com</b> - I've somehow managed to make the GitHub visual experience even worse by reducing it to wireframe. See that huge gaping white space? That's what remains after closing the information boxes that used to be there upon first creating an account. Removing those boxes actually made the site easier to navigate because our eyes go straight for the good stuff, that is, our repositories. That's all we came for, I hope.

<h3>Websites Worth a Visit</h3>
</span>
</a>

<span class="post 1" style="display:none;">
<a href="http://www.spotify.com" target="_blank">
<img class="image" src="../unit1_projects/images/spotify.jpg"></a>
<p class="text">
<b>Spotify.com</b> is a music streaming site. I'm a paid subscriber and I use the app on my PC and smartphone every day. Spotify is the way to go for music because it allows you to listen to any song, album or artist on demand. Paid subscribers can download songs to their device to access when offline. Today I checked out the website as opposed to the downloaded app. As the face of the business, this is where Spotify has a chance to make a first impression in hopes of selling its service. The close-up, candid action shots convey a fun-loving attitude that isn't difficult to associate with music on the go. As an aspiring web developer, I am particularly impressed with the way the pictures scroll in tandem with text content. The foreground of text scrolls faster than the alternating photos of twenty-somethings livin' life, giving a stunning, yet humble suggestion that using Spotify is a good idea. Check out Spotify (at least the homepage)!
</p>

<a href="http://www.css-tricks.com" target="_blank">
<img class="image" src="../unit1_projects/images/css-tricks.jpg"></a>
<p class="text">
<b>css-tricks.com</b> is a great site I discovered the other day, probably in the midst of frantically tryin to coax div-a and div-b to behave with div-c. I was instantly drawn to the design of this site. The colors are very appealing and entice the viewer to stay a while and explore. Something very clever I noticed in the design of this site was that it rearranges itself to three distinct layouts as you squish the width of the browser window. I'm not talking the default automatic stuff. The navigation tabs change shape and arrangement. The brown border between each box actually disappears to allow more concise viewing at the smallest with. This is the first time I've noticed such a reactive scheme on a web page. The footer of the site discloses that it was made on WordPress. Is that cheating? Either way, this site is both useful and beautiful.
</p>

<a href="http://www.github.com/explore" target="_blank">
<img class="image" src="../unit1_projects/images/github.jpg"></a>
<p class="text">
<b>GitHub.com</b> is an online marketplace for developers to share code. I suppose non-developers could grab some code from GitHub as well, but the site is so overwhelming, I wouldn't want to go near it if I didn't have to. As a relatively new user, GitHub is like a dark basement with a noisy furnace; I'm only going down there to get a screwdriver or change the cat's litter box, and then I'm gone. In lieu of intimidation factor, GitHub is a fantastically practical tool for web development. I've attempted to show its bright and colorful side with a screenshot of the "Explore" page, but the truth is, GitHub is not bright and colorful. It is a confusing web of oversharing. Maybe it's nothing more than my own inexperience, but when it comes to GitHub I want to git what I came for and git out. Fortunately, I'd rather interact with GitHub from the safety of my command line.
