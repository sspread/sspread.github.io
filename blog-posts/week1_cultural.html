<h3>PEP TALK</h3>
</span>

<p>
Shereef's Fireside Chat is by far the most motivational piece I have ever seen filmed on a web cam. As I watched his video to attempt to wrap up week 1 prep material during the hours of the night I should be sleeping, I felt a great sense of purpose: a late-night call to arms, but also a reality check. What have I gotten myself into!? I have a better sense now then I did before.</p>

<p>
I understand that participating in Dev Bootcamp is like working in the kitchen with a bunch of aspiring chefs to make a big batch of experimental soup, with some hair in it... and it sounds delicious. I really appreciate an approach to learning wherein the students and teachers have an "in this together" mentality to create something wonderful through intense, focused effort; this is in stark contrast to the consumerist education we've come to expect.</p>

<p>
Shereef's response to listener questions in the chat was encouraging because it brought about a discussion that was ever so relevant to my own concerns. While the answers didn't exactly alleviate my fears, they made me feel that I was among others, and that it will be ok, if I'm willing to give it my all. I'm ready for an adventure.<p>
