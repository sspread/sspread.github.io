        <h3>Driver and Navigator</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Driver is typing code into the editor</li>
                <li>Navigator is dictating what is typed</li>
                <li>The person with the idea is the navigator; this can switch fluidly</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you have two people working on something, you can fill in the gaps in one another's knowledge.</li>
                <li>Two brains are better than one</li>
                <li>The driving/navigating structure collectively allows focus on both thought process and syntax.</li> 
            </ul>

        <h3>First Experience...</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> It was strange to pair with someone over the computer.</li>
                <li> I enjoyed the opportunity to bounce ideas.
                <li> Pairing with someone helped keep me on track, as I tend to explore things I don't understand.</li>
                <li> The view feature on Stypi didn't work. My pair was MIA.</li>
