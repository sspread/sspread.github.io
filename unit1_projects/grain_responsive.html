<h3>Whole Grain</h3>
<p><i>Whole grain</i> foods contain all the essential parts and naturally-occuring nutrients of the entire grain seed in their original proportions. If the grain has been processed (e.g., cracked, crushed, rolled, extruded and/or cooked), the food product should deliver the same rich balance of nutrients that are found in the original grain seed. <a href="http://wholegrainscouncil.org/" target="_blank">Visit some folks who love whole grain</a>.</p>

<h3>Gluten?</h3>
<p><i>Gluten</i> is a mixture of two proteins found in cereal grains that gives dough an elastic texture. <i>Celiac disease</i> is a condition caused by abnormal immunte response to gluten, and can cause damage to the lining of the small intestine. While experts estimate that about 1% of Americans have the disease, only 5% to 10% are diagnosed. As such, symptoms including diarrhea, anemia, bone pain and sever skin rash could go unexplained. </p>
<p><b>Gluten-free diets</b>    are gaining popularity. While very few people actually have celiac disease, some people claim to be sensitive to gluten and even more people are attempting to cut gluten for fear that there is more to the story.</p>
