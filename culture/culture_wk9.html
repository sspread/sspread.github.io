            <h2>Asking Appropriate Questions</h2>
            <h4>
                <small>August 24.2014</small>
            </h4>
            <h4>Coding Community</h4>
            <p>The internet has become a wealth of knowledge and this wealth seems to have especially been allocated to the coding community. I am impressed with the amount of free tutorials and helpful forums exist at my fingertips. In fact, I was having a conversation last night with some fellow Dev Bootcamp classmates about whether the remote Phase 0 learning model at DBC could be successfully extended to other disciplines. While it probably could to some degree, I would argue that the online web development community is especially robust, perhaps because everyone's work revolves around the realm of online.</p>

            <h4>Good Question-Asking Procedure</h4>
            <p>To help build and also get the most from this community, you've gotta ask questions. Sounds simple enough, right? Well, there's a few important things to remember when asking for help. Here is some advice I picked up when reading <a href="http://blogs.msmvps.com/jonskeet/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/">Writing the Perfect Question</a>.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Provide context. If readers understand your overall goal, they may be able to point out a completely different approach to get there; something you may never get if you only mention the specific task.</li>

                <li>Provide sample code. Now, this one is tricky. I know I appreciate sample code when I'm researching and reading questions and responses. Also, when I've attempted to answer a question in our class community, I always ask for the code. But, I can imagine that in a big project it can be difficult decide how much sample code to provide. What makes sense here is reading over the question and the code from an outsider's shoes and determining if there is ample code to get the gist, but not a speck more!</li>

                <li>Disclose what you've already tried. This is useful from a practical approach because it helps the readers understand your way of thinking. Less obvious, explaining what you've already tried can encourage people to help you because it signals that you actually put in some work to your own problem.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Research for Yourself!</h4>
            Building on that last list point, I think people are happy to help you when they can appreciate your bewilderment and respect your own efforts in solving the problem. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">Stack Overflow</a> recommends pretending you're talking to a busy colleague. I can relate to this advice because I learned about researching for myself in my first job out of college. Everyone offered to help in answering any questions I might have had as a beginner. So, I freely asked questions, thinking that I would learn faster that way than trying to figure everything out myself. I soon realized that people were always busy, and that my questions could be bothersome. There is something implicit after <i>"Feel free to ask me questions..."</i>, to the tune of <i>"...as a last resort"</i>. Initially put off a little, I eventually became quite self-sufficient in figuring things out myself, reserving questions for when they were absolutely necessary. And, when I did seek to ask a question, I would spend some time to prepare an outline or understandable example of the problem, so as to make the most out of everyone's time.</p>

            <p>I think this lesson is even more applicable to an online community like Stack Overflow because people don't have the same personal accountability for not pro-actively helping you.</p>
