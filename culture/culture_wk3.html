                    <h2>Thinking and Learning about Thinking and Learning</h2>
                    <h4><small>July 10.2014</small></h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. Anthony Gregorc brought us the <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Mind Styles Model</a> in 1984.</b> If you take a short thinking style quiz, Dr. G will tell you how your mind works. My mind is <i>Concrete Random</i>. My <i>concrete</i> perceptual quality enables me to process information by sensing and doing what's in front of me, versus visualizing and imagining in the <i>abstract</i>. My <i>random</i> ordering ability allows me to organize information in chunks, as opposed to in a <i>sequential</i>, linear way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Interpreted, I solve problems when I'm tinkering. I'm not convinced until I've seen something work by my own hands. Reading a solution or textbook isn't going to cut it. I don't want to document my work or think about what steps I took. I know when I understand it and that's the end of it. And I absolutely hate memorizing things.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This style of learning is great for conquering the toughest challenges in DBC because a lot is unknown and I am comfortable diving right in. However, this approach poses some challenges of its own in the course. I often find myself going down rabbit holes and struggling to finish the required tasks in a timely manner. I find reflections and "check-box" to-do lists very cumbersome. I'd rather spend that time experimenting with concepts that I've discovered that might be outside the scope of what's asked of me. To address these pitfalls, I've made it a priority to finish the tasks and reflections first before allowing myself to venture down paths of curiosity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Now let's look at growth vs. fixed mindset.</b> A growth mindset is a tendency for one to believe that intelligence can be developed; someone with a growth mindset tends to embrace effort, challenges setbacks and criticism. A fixed mindset is a tendency for one to believe that intelligence is static, yet maintain the the desire to appear smart to others; someone with a fixed mindset tends to shy away from challenges, avoid effort, become discouraged by setbacks and be defensive towards criticism.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unlike Dr. Gregorc's four buckets for learning styles, this dichotomy of mindsets seems to present the "correct" attribute: a growth mindset. I think it's helpful to not try convince yourself that you have the ideal growth mindset; rather, you should strive for a growth mindset regardless of where you stand. <i>Grow</i> the growth mindset.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In DBC, I aim to embrace my Mind Style while branching outside of my comfort zone. I make it a priority to put thought into my reflections after each challenge. I make time to pair with others on challenges, even if I'd prefer to tackle them alone. I've already experienced the benefit of working with people of varying coding experience. I can learn a great deal from someone with more skills because they simply have a lot to show me. Alternatively, I can solidify my current understanding of concepts and by practicing my ability to explain concepts to someone more novice.
