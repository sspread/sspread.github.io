            <h2>The Tech Gender Gap... Problem?</h2>
            <h4>
                <small>July 15.2014</small>
            </h4>

            <h4>A Scary Number</h4>
            <p>Google recently released statistics of its employee breakdown by gender. Its tech workforce is about 17% women. That's almost 5 to 1 men. Surprised? Yes. Alarmed? Not necessarily.</p>

            <p>No doubt, men vastly outnumber women when it comes to working in this industry. As a reaction, companies have set up programs and committed funds to getting more women into programming. Case in point: Google has promised to spend $50 million to teach girls how to code. It has to do <i>something</i>, right!? 17% does not equal 50%! It's bad PR.</p>

            <h4>When it's a Problem</h4>
            <img class="image" src="../images/mens_room.jpg" style="float:left; padding-bottom:0;">
            <p>An online search will return countless articles about the gender gap problem. But far fewer actually explain <i>why gap = problem</i>. To make this logical leap at face value could be a mistake. Let's look at a potential cause and a potential effect that <i>would</i> be evidence of a problem.</p>

            <p>Cause = sexism. Discrimination based on gender. Women are not allowed into tech because the gatekeepers have something against the XX. Job qualifications and aptitude have nothing to do with it - if you are a woman, your would-be boss won't hire you and your could-be co-workers won't play nicely. If sexism is at the root of the gender gap, then we have a problem. The gap isn't the problem though; it's the result of a much bigger problem with society.</p>

            <p>Regardless of the cause for the gender gap, the he-she disparity could be an issue for the industry if women are not represented proportionately. Women make up over half the world's population, and half of video game players. Certainly, we don't want decision makers and designers to be out of touch with the relevant market. The field has switched from mostly female to mostly male since the '60s. The stereotypical computer programmer is often an intelligent, but socially inept male. Has this caused problems in the end products? Have we experienced communication breakdown between tech developers and the end users, based on gender proportion difference on either side? If the answer is yes in the future, there may be a free market flow of women to tech.</p>

            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <p>Of course, there may be other issues at play, but the aforementioned comprise a great deal of the concern in discussions about the tech gender gap. Likewise, there could be a plethora of unproblematic reasons as well. My point is to question the actual "problem" because it dictates the best solution. The big idea recently is to throw money at the gender gap in order to close it. Why? Money won't change sexism, if that is the problem. Money could potentially solve accessibility problems should they exist, but lack of funding for education and job placement for females specifically does not seem to be the issue. Finally, money creates incentives, for all people. To pump money into education is to provide a reason for people to try learning about programming, that isn't related to passion for programming. Is money the reason why we want people to do something, or lack thereof the cause for why people aren't doing it?</p>

            <p>So, the first step to finding a solution to the tech gender gap problem is to determine if there is a problem. Men and women are different, and cultural tendencies complex. Women dominate nursing at even more lopsided ratios than men do tech. Our goal should be to create an environment that fosters opportunity for each <i>person</i> to pursue a career as he or she pleases, and not necessarily focus on making two variables equal.</p>
