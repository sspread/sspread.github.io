                    <h2>Values, etc.</h2>
                    <h4><small>August 6.2014</small></h4>


                <p>This week we're exploring our values. I've selected the following values from an exhausting, but not exhaustive, list because they stand out in happy times. The 'influence' rating comes from a 5-point scale of the extent to which I agree that I generally <i>try</i> to live up to the value. In other words, the degree to which it influences my conduct.</p>

                <table class="values">
                    <tbody>
                        <th>Value</th>
                        <th>Influence</th>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Ambition</td>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Adventure</td>
                            <td>4</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Control</td>
                            <td>4</td>
                        </tr>

                            <td>Enthusiasm</td>
                            <td>4</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Health</td>
                            <td>5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Honesty</td>
                            <td>5</td>
                        </tr>

                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <h4>Health</h4>
                <p>I would like to talk about Health. From good mental and physical health flows positive energy, tranquility and ultimately happiness. Of course, health is not the only thing you need, but I believe that health is like a gatekeeper for so much other good in life. Good health stabilizes me and opens the door to chasing dreams, gaining knowledge, building relationships, exploring the world and helping others. The value of health is most apparent when I'm without it. If I get sick, I find that nothing else matters until I recover, so I make preventative maintenance a conscious priority.</p>

                <h4>Awareness</h4>
                <p>I feel loosey goosey trying to quantify and prioritize my values, which are indefinite, intangible and often unconscious. Nonetheless, I see the value in doing so. Seeking to identify the values that make me happy, proud or satisfied calls for heavy self-reflection and honesty. Ideally, I bring those values into awareness. If I'm aware of something, I'm more likely to have control over it. If I have control over it, I'm more likely able to shape it to my liking. From exploring these values, I can identify discrepancies between values that I associate with happiness, and of those, values that drive my behavior (higher rated). One reason these are not all 5s could be because I haven't taken the time to identify them.</p>

                <p>Speaking of awareness, see last week's post for one perspective as it relates to stereotype threat.</p>

                <h4>Advice</h4>
                <p>Part of this post is supposed to be about the last time someone asked me for advice. I introduce this section this way because I think it jolts my flow here. Anyway, my friend called me for insight about accepting a job offer she had received, while she awaited a response from another more desirable company. Not such a bad dilemma to be in, if you ask me. So, we broke it down into logical pieces (as I'm apt to do), thinking about the best, worst and most likely outcome under each scenario.</p>

                <p>Now I'm going to conclude this post with that unrelated bit. Or maybe it's not unrelated, and thinking about the last time someone elicited advice from me should provide a clue about how others perceive my values.</p>
