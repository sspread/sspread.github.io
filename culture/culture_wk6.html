            <h2>Damn You, Stereotype Threat</h2>
            <h4>
                <small>July 31.2014</small>
            </h4>

            <p>In 1995, Steele and Aronson published a study that formally introduced the stereotype threat. The researchers gave a difficult portion of the GRE to African-American and European-American participants. They attempted to indirectly evoke the cognitive availability of a stereotype in the participants by describing one of the tests as "diagnostic of intellectual ability". They found that African-Americans scored lower on this test. They attributed this underperformance to the risk that an individual felt that doing so would confirm as self-characteristic the negative stereotype about one's group. The negative stereotype in this study presumably being that African-Americans perform more poorly than European-Americans on standardized tests.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of studies exhibit the effects of stereotype threat on performance, and it transcends race to gender, age and so on. The key that makes this threat damaging appears to be in the <i>awareness</i> of the stereotype. An individual commented on The Atlantic article entitled "Thin Ice: Stereotype Threat and Black College Students". He claims to be an African who recently came to America, and so had not been exposed to the negative stereotypes regarding intelligence that are directed at African-Americans. As such, he had been able to "disregard [his] group identity as a factor in most roles". He had no conception of how his "blackness" affected him academically, so it did not affect him.</p>

            <p>The preceding anecdote offers a helpful point when considering how to attenuate the stereotype threat. While awareness of stereotypes weighs on an individual in certain situations, perhaps awareness of the concept of the stereotype threat is enough to mitigate it to some degree. In a 100-level psychology or sociology class, you might learn about a number of biases or predispositions that seem to come pre-loaded in the human brain. Some serve as helpful heuristics, but many can be harmful to making the best judgments (i.e. stereotyping). I find that learning about and becoming aware that these notions can sneak into cognition is paramount to optimum critical thinking, from big-time resolutions down to every-day decisions.</p>

            <p>As individuals, we will have a tough time directly combating prevalent stereotypes, but we do have some control over how these stereotypes affect our performance. By understanding that stereotype threat "is a thing", we can identify the situations wherein it is likely to rear its ugly head. When we find ourselves in those situations, we are prepared for our fears because they are familiar, and we can gain confidence in our abilities in spite of what we perceive the stereotype to dictate of our aptitude. The stereotype may be alive and well, but the <i>threat</i> we feel that apprehends our flair is but within ourselves.</p>
