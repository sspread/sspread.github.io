            <h4>A Collegiate Conflict</h4>
            <p>A particular conflict I had with a college food science instructor stands out. It began one evening when I realized that the recent exam scores had been posted online. Except, mine was not among them. I figured there had been some processing error, so I emailed the instructor to inquire. In return, I received an email informing me that I had two options: 1) write an essay, or 2) take a 10% score reduction. WHY? Because I didn't inform them that my score wasn't posted within a week of the mass posting.</p>

            <p>Well, I didn't know about the posting because my score wasn't there when I checked. Nor did I know about the one week rule. I was When I looked at the syllabus, I saw the one-week rule referenced, but there was also mention of the period being for two weeks. I pointed out the inconsistency to my instructor in an email, clearly showing the conflicting information in the text. I knew that it was a typo, but I felt that the rule was so ridiculous and unfair that I latched on to the apparent error to make my case.</p>

            <p>She retorted by referencing the syllabus again. Alas, the inconsistency I had pointed out was gone, with no mention of the error! Growing quite frustrated, I emailed her again to acknowledge her devious tactics. This conversation actually went back and forth for some time (I was able to pull up the old emails just now - Becky was her name), each email becoming ever slightly more hostile. By the end, we were both directly pointing out each other's errors. Finally, Becky invited me to her office later that week to resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>I walked into her office hopeful for a peaceful and mutual resolution. What I got was something else. Becky glared at me with beady eyes. She was tall, lanky and had nappy hair. I had before only seen her from a distance in a huge lecture hall. Now, I had reason to believe that she lived with more than one cat. It was a one-way conversation. She told what a terrible person I was and how she could only blame my parents for raising such an ill-mannered young man. She wished me the best of luck out there in the world, as if she truly doubted I could ever find success. My insides were boiling at this point. But, I realized there was no reasoning or two ways around it. She had invited me to her office strictly to tell me off. I asked, "Are we done here?" and I was on my way. Later that evening I wrote a stupid two page essay about lycopene, sent it to Becky, and that was the end of it.</p>

            <h4>Looking back...</h4>
            <p>This conflict is trivial in retrospect. However, at the time I felt like standing up to the institution, sticking it to "the man". Even though I was technically in violation of the rule, I disagreed with the rule, so I fought it. It was like getting a parking ticket in an open space when the no-parking sign was half a block away. However, the conflict became personal. I really didn't want to go there. So, I swallowed my pride and played by the rules. It simply wasn't worth escalating any further. I don't think I would change anything if I did it again. It was a learning experience. I guess I realized that if I'm not going to change the rules, then there's no sense in making a big fuss about them. I could have said "yes, ma'am" from the start and avoided the whole thing, but I think it's important to challenge the status quo sometimes, to an extent.</p>
